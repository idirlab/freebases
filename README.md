# Variants of Freebase for Robust Development of Intelligent Tasks on Knowledge Graphs

## Overview

This repository contains the dataset, preprocessing scripts, and experiment results to the paper [Creating Variants of Freebase for Robust Development of Intelligent Tasks on Knowledge Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ikw7gqAGz7A), where we lay out a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and impacts associated with three idiosyncrasies(Mediator Nodes, Reverse Triples, and Metadata/Administrative Data) of Freebase, a large-scale, open-domain knowledge graph, on intelligent tasks such as link prediction, graph query system, and graph-to-text generation. 

## Dataset

Four clean variants of Freebase dataset are provided by inclusion/exclusion of various data modeling idiosyncrasies, which encables researchers to leverage or avoid such features based on the nature of their tasks. **The dataset can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/idzqsh1a34swaz0/Freebases.zip?dl=0).**

The dataset consists of the four variants of Freebase dataset as well as related mapping/support files.
