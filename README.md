## Variants of Freebase for Robust Development of Intelligent Tasks on Knowledge Graphs

In this work we laid out a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with the idiosyncrasies of Freebase dataset, measured their impact on tasks such as link prediction, and provided several variants of the Freebase dataset by inclusion/exclusion of various data modeling idiosyncrasies. Therefore, one can grasp the opportunity to leverage or avoid such features based on the nature of their tasks. Furthermore, the datasets underwent thorough cleaning in order to improve their utility.
